# Templating

**Author**: Ryan Groesch and Lacy Hogan
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is a blog with consistent formating so that users can have the same experience every time they visit. It needs to use Handlebars library to dynamically render the articles. It needs to use modern JavaScript so that it is up to date with industry standards. 

## Getting Started
The Handlebars.js CDN must be added to the HTML. The Handlebars template needs to be added to the head of the HTML. The Article.prototype.toHtml method needs to be updated to utilize the Handlebars template. The functions and methods, where possible, need to be refactored to use ES6 arrows functions. 

## Architecture
JQuery and Handlebar libraries, as well as arrow functions will be used to accomplish these.
